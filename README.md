## Description
The idea of this project was inspired by a close family member looking to start this type of business in the near future. This is the React.js frontend utilizing React Hooks and React Router. It allows the business owner to show who they are and what they provide. It is a place for potential customers to learn about the company, see the services they provide, results/testimonials, subscribe to a membership, schedule an appointment, or contact the company.
